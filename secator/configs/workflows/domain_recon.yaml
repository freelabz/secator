long_description: |
  Performs comprehensive reconnaissance on a domain to gather essential information.
  Collects WHOIS data, probes HTTP services, detects technologies, analyzes SSL/TLS security,
  resolves DNS records, retrieves ASN information, and identifies any Web Application Firewalls (WAF).
  Ideal for understanding a domain's infrastructure and security posture before deeper testing.
